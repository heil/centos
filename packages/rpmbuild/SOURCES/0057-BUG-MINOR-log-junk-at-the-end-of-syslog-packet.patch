Subject: [PATCH 57/67] BUG/MINOR: log: junk at the end of syslog packet

With a facily of 2 or 1 digit, the send size was wrong and bytes with
unknown value were sent.
The size was calculated using the start of the buffer and not the start
of the data which varies with the number of digits of the facility.

This bug was reported by Samuel Stoller and reported by Lukas Tribus.
