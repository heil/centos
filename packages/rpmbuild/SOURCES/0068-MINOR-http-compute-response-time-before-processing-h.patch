Subject: [PATCH 68/85] MINOR: http: compute response time before processing
 headers

At the moment, HTTP response time is computed after response headers are
processed. This can misleadingly assign to the server some heavy local
processing (eg: regex), and also prevents response headers from passing
information related to the response time (which can sometimes be useful
for stats).

Let's retrieve the reponse time before processing the headers instead.

Note that in order to remain compatible with what was previously done,
we disable the response time when we get a 502 or any bad response. This
should probably be changed in 1.6 since it does not make sense anymore
to lose this information.
