Subject: [PATCH 16/37] BUG/MINOR: cli: "clear table" did not work anymore
 without a key

Will Glass-Husain reported this breakage which was caused by commit
dec9814e merged in 1.5-dev12, and which was incomplete, resulting in
both "clear table" and "show table" to do the same thing.

No backport is needed.
