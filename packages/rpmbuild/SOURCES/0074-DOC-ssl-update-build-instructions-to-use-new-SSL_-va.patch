Subject: [PATCH 74/85] DOC: ssl: update build instructions to use new SSL_*
 variables

Since commit 9a05945bd ("BUILD: add SSL_INC/SSL_LIB variables to force the
path to openssl") we have SSL_INC and SSL_LIB to point to the libssl
installation.

This commits updates the build instructions in README accordingly.
